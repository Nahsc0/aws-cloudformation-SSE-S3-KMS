# CloudFormation Template for Deploying S3 with User-selectable Encryption

This project provides a CloudFormation template that allows users to deploy an S3 bucket with the ability to select the encryption type. The template ensures that all the necessary values, such as the bucket name and encryption type, are inputted by the user during the stack creation. Additionally, it leverages CloudFormation Outputs to provide information about the created resources.

## Solution Overview

The CloudFormation template included in this project automates the deployment of an S3 bucket with user-configurable encryption options. Here's an overview of the solution:

1. **User Input**: The template prompts the user to provide a unique bucket name and select the desired encryption type. The encryption options include SSE-S3 (default S3 encryption) and KMS (Key Management Service) encryption.

2. **Template Configuration**: The CloudFormation template is configured to accept user input as parameters. It validates the encryption type input against the allowed values to ensure a valid selection.

3. **Resource Provisioning**: The template provisions an S3 bucket based on the provided input values. It uses the selected encryption type to configure the appropriate server-side encryption settings for the bucket.

4. **Outputs**: After the stack creation is complete, the template provides outputs with relevant information about the deployed resources. This includes the bucket name and the encryption type used for the S3 bucket.

## Prerequisites

To use this CloudFormation template, you need:

- An AWS account with sufficient permissions to create CloudFormation stacks and provision S3 resources.
- Knowledge of AWS CloudFormation and its usage.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the CloudFormation template.

2. Deploy the CloudFormation stack using one of the following methods:
   - AWS Management Console: Upload the CloudFormation template file and provide the required input values through the console wizard.
   - AWS CLI: Use the `create-stack` command and pass the template file and input parameter values as arguments.
   - AWS SDKs: Utilize the CloudFormation APIs to programmatically create the stack and provide the necessary input parameters.

3. During the stack creation, provide the requested input values, including the bucket name and encryption type. Ensure the encryption type matches one of the allowed values: SSE-S3 or KMS.

4. Wait for the stack creation to complete. Once the stack is successfully created, you can access the outputs for the bucket name and encryption type.

## Additional Customizations

The provided CloudFormation template serves as a starting point and can be customized further based on your requirements. Here are a few potential modifications you might consider:

- Adding additional resources or configurations to the template, such as bucket policies, access controls, or notifications.
- Incorporating other AWS services alongside the S3 bucket deployment, like AWS Lambda functions or Amazon CloudFront distributions.
- Implementing tagging strategies, logging configurations, or lifecycle policies for the S3 bucket.
